# NASA Bioscience Explorer

An interactive, AI-assisted dashboard for exploring NASA bioscience publications. It summarizes papers, enables semantic search, and visualizes relationships via a 2D knowledge graph so users can quickly discover impacts, trends, and connections across hundreds of studies.

## âœ¨ Overview

- Beautiful, responsive UI built in React + Tailwind
- Paper tiles with rich summaries (title, authors, abstract, keywords, significance)
- AI chatbot (Gemini) that answers questions in the context of the opened paper
- Semantic search across all papers (title, abstract, keywords, category, citations)
- Interactive 2D Knowledge Graph with modes for Connections, Topic Clusters, and Citations
- CSV-backed dataset (608 papers) parsed and enriched client-side

## ðŸ§  How it works

1) Data ingestion
- `src/services/api.js` parses the provided CSV (title + link) and enriches each record with:
  - generated abstract, keywords, category, authors, publication date, citations, significance
  - related paper suggestions for graph connections
- All pages/components use these in-memory objects as the data source.

2) Semantic search
- A lightweight scoring function ranks papers by query relevance using:
  - title (highest weight), abstract, keywords, category, and citations
- UI: `SemanticSearchBar` + `SearchResults` shows ranked results and quick insights.

3) Knowledge Graph (2D Canvas)
- `src/components/KnowledgeGraph2D.js` renders papers as nodes and relationships as links
- Modes:
  - Research Connections: similarity/related links
  - Topic Clusters: category-based groupings with readable labels
  - Citation Network: node size/color influenced by citation counts
- Interactions: pan, zoom, hover tooltip with title, click to open paper detail

4) Paper detail
- `src/pages/PaperDetail.js` shows the selected paperâ€™s summary, insights, and the graph
- The graph receives the full paper list so you can explore relationships from that context.

5) AI Chatbot (Gemini)
- `src/services/geminiService.js` builds a prompt with the current paperâ€™s metadata
- Uses `REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY` to call Gemini (model: `gemini-1.5-flash`),
  with a robust local fallback only if the API is unavailable.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js â‰¥ 16
- npm â‰¥ 8

### Install & run
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app starts at http://localhost:3000

### Environment variables (for AI chatbot)
Create `.env.local` in the project root:
```
REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_KEY_HERE
```
Restart the dev server after adding or changing environment variables.
